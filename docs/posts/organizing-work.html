            <h1>problems / pain points</h1>
<p>organizing is hard because organizing is personal
youtube and books are often an echo chamber of quippy titles and tired opinions
and there's no metrics on whether these systems are good or bad
worse - some people will claim "you aren't doing it right" if it they're method isn't helpful to you
JIRA is fucking awful - it's both too rigid and too unstructured? how did they manage that</p>
<h1>wants / needs / requirements</h1>
<p>a way to organize information according to <em>my</em> job, work, hobbies, and taste
something the scales with the pace of work. sometimes tasks are fast, sometimes tasks take months
something not on the computer - </p>
<h1>features / solutions / tasks</h1>
<p>if you're reading this right now - you're looking at it!
Split conceptual phrases into references, pain, needs and features</p>
<p>features / solutions / tasks are actionable or enacted
i draw a box to each to signify if i've started or not, finished, or moved to another page
<code>/</code> for started
<code>&gt;</code> for moved
<code>X</code> for finished
I divide my journal into 4 sections by foldding and scoring with a pen and write my tasks on the last section
this way, if i run out of room i can continue on the next page and use the fold to see what was on old pages for transcription</p>
<p>the preceding column is for needs
typically this is a place for short meeting notes,
so i can take note of something someone else or myself wants that we dont have a solution of task ready for
what differentiates it? a need may have multiple possible solutions.
"I need to have Data Uploaded" doesn't include a statement of work or description if batching or streaming is required</p>
<p>problems / pain points - records of times my job pisses me off, or errors i encounter that i dont have time to fix</p>
<p>references - information i probably want to remember that I know i likely wont
stuff like processing times, quantities of datasets, crucical numbers and metrics I want to report about etc</p>
