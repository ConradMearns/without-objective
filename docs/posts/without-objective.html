            <p>It's often impossible to motivate myself to build something for myself.</p>
<p>For my day job, it's easy. Delivering impact is the game, and I play it well. I avoid feature-factory teams like the plague, I attach myself to people and personalities who don't know how to manage software expectations, and I blow their socks off as often as I can. </p>
<p>I've built front-end web apps for Cloud and Desktop deployments alike. I've done embedded RF development, interfaced ML with real time operating systems, managed and evangelized DevOps practices like IaC.</p>
<p>I burn myself out a lot. </p>
<p>I have built little to nothing of value for myself.</p>
<p>I think about why occasionally, but it's rare I give myself a truly acceptable and fair answer. Out of all of the reasons - I think the concept that has done the most damage to me over the past 5 years has been the notion of "Gardening" applied to knowledge-based disciplines.</p>
<p>I first encountered the notion of information-wise "Gardening" somewhere after reading How to Take Smart Notes, and after diving headfirst into Zettlekasten construction. These also happened to be the early days of Roam, and eventually Obsidian. I thought surely - given the new community and our individual but shared efforts of organizing and amplifying our power of understanding, at some point I'll have a computer that can help me to organize my projects, tasks, thoughts, rambles and more. I'll finally start finishing projects, I'll finally be <em>productive.</em></p>
<p>For writing, the system was simple. Write rough verbosely. These are your scraps as I called them - other's called them seeds. Over time, you were suggested to fix up these notes. Separate them based on context like Zettlekasten. Organize links between them, name them. [[Cf Note title is an API]] Over time, this would become an "Evergreen Note". Think of a note or article with the solidity of a Wikipedia Article. (I like this as an example too: https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html)</p>
<p>The main concept of gardening was - start small, start anywhere, start in any way you can. Over time, prune and trim and water your thoughts and grow them into something bigger and more useful - like you would a garden.</p>
<p>Once I started gardening with <em>real</em> plants I finally understood how much bullshit this philosophy is. At least - how much bullshit the philosophy I came to understand was.</p>
<p>True gardening doesn't take as much energy and dedication as a collection of notes. Gardening can be a lot of work - but for the most part, I'm just doing damage control. I did not create the seeds, nor the soil, nor the sun, nor the systems at play which permit them to grow. I put maybe less than 5 minutes a day into fairly mindless tasks of watering. After the summer, most of these plants are likely to die - and new ones will be planted the following season. Unlike my notes - which I've consistently tried to take with me <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>Most gardens are grown to flower, or to produce fruit. Most trees which are grown, are grown to harvest.</p>
<p>The biggest distinction is that as my collections of plants grows - from a table of saplings to acres of farmland, the amount of work I must commit to grows extremely slowly. Before modern equipment, it was said that a single person could tend a hectare of farmland per year. Now - a single farmhand with the help of combines, tractors, pesticides, and even weed-eating robots can tend to huge farms. </p>
<p>Each note however - requires certain dedicated amounts of energy for it to progress to each new stage of it's useful life.</p>
<p>And - just like code, the more text we produce, the more we must manage ourselves, and the thinner we spread ourselves out.</p>
<p>So why does this matter? Why does this notion impact the work I do not commit to for my own sake?</p>
<p>I reject the demand I implicitly create for myself to do future work.</p>
<p>I don't mean to - and in fact, I didn't understand why I couldn't commit to my own projects for a long time. Part of me, perhaps, wanted to trust that the tools I made for myself were of the highest quality. Part of me knew, they never would be. Part of me also knew - that trying to fix 3 month old code built on a whim in esoteric languages is actually hell.</p>
<p>I've continued to remain silent on the internet - not because I wanted to hide my thoughts or projects, but because I inevitably didn't care to put the time and energy <em>others</em> put into their creative communication. I don't always want to edit my writing, I don't always want to have the perfect post, I don't want to spend all month making my website nice and tidy, and I don't want to manage myself like I am managed at work - committed to an endless stream of pointless tasks to tweak and tune systems that aren't that fun to tune and fiddle with.</p>
<p>So where is this rant heading? My goal for now: commit to fewer goals. Build and act <em>Without Objectives</em>. Create for the purpose of creating, and be more comfortable with putting projects to bed.</p>
<p>The systems I build for myself should be more like true gardens. Ready to die in the soil I planted them in. Waiting for the next season so that their pieces can be cannibalized by another.</p>

<p>Bonus content - Things I Keep Telling Myself</p>
<p>GitHub ain't too bad. I don't mind hosting much of my code there - and I already use it to host my broken website. Each repository can have it's own website even - so why not take advantage of that? Just let the project be - and if you need a webpage then build one otherwise don't sweat it - a README will do just fine.</p>
<p>Bluesky and other public - facing social media platforms are honestly great places to mediate discussions. They're just not utilized well. I constantly dream of a platform that unifying Ted Nelson's concept for Xanadu with Social Networking - but Twitter clones are good enough for now. You don't need a comment system - just send link's to friends as if you are sending letters in days of old.</p>
<p>The task of formatting still sucks. Markdown isn't semantic, semantics in NLP is hard, XML hurts my eyes, and I don't want to care about it any longer. </p>
<p>Large Language Models are here to stay. Everyone has their opinions and ethics and morals are still being built in regards to how these things should be treated/used. Regardless of the result - they are fun to play with and so will likely be here forever. They aren't great for everything - they hallucinate, lie, are shitty writers, plagiarize and more - but sometimes these are strengths. Ask an AI for writing advice - not because it's good, because the recoil you feel in your gut will send you on the path you most agree with anyway. (Like Cunningham's Law - but always put yourself in the position of the adjudicator)</p>
