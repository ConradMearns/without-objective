# Observation Log: Evidence-based relationship tracking
#
# Columns:
# - date: When observation was made (YYYY-MM-DD)
# - observer: Who made the observation
# - relationship_type: problem-to-need, need-to-feature, or feature-to-problem
# - from_item: The source (problem, need, or feature key)
# - to_item: The target (need, feature, or problem key)
# - strength: 1 (contributes), -1 (inversely contributes), or 0 (no relationship)
# - evidence: What was observed/measured
# - source: Where the evidence came from
