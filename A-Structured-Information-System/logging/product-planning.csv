# Feature Mapping:
# F00: observation-log - A log of observations used for quantifying customer observations of system attributes and relations
# F01: relationship-scoring - 5/3/1 strength indicators to quantify problem-need-feature connections
# F02: flat-relationship-scoring - Only use a strength indicator of 1 to quantify problem-need-feature connections
#
# Values: +1 (contributes), -1 (inversely contributes), ~ (no observation)
# Format: strength or strength(count) where count is number of observations
