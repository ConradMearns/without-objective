# Problem Mapping:
# P00: aggregation-paradox - Collective preference aggregation is logically inconsistent - team scoring produces mathematically invalid rankings
# P01: missing-customer-voice - System captures team assumptions about problems/needs, not validated customer behavior or willingness to pay
# P02: cost-blindness - Ranks by strategic importance but ignores implementation cost, time, budget, and opportunity cost
# P03: time-blindness - Treats features as independent choices, ignoring prerequisites, sequences, lock-ins, and time-sensitive windows
# P04: risk-ignorance - All relationships scored as if outcomes were known, no modeling of execution risk or market uncertainty
# P05: competitive-blindness - No awareness of competitors, table stakes, first-mover advantage, or commoditization pressure
# P06: scoring-subjectivity - Relationship scores are fuzzy opinions that can be gamed or manipulated for political purposes
# P07: cognitive-biases - Recency, availability, confirmation, and anchoring biases distort scoring without awareness
# P08: static-analysis - Analysis becomes outdated as customer needs, problems, technology, and market conditions change
# P09: feedback-loop-gaps - Can't predict how solving problems changes behavior, creates new problems, or enables compound effects
# P10: garbage-in-garbage-out - Bad problem definitions, inaccurate scores, missing perspectives, or homogeneous teams produce confidently wrong answers
#
# Values: +1 (contributes), -1 (inversely contributes), ~ (no observation)
# Format: strength or strength(count) where count is number of observations
