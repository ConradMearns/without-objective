# Problem Mapping:
# P00: morning-rush-chaos - Long lines during peak hours drive customers to competitors
# P01: remote-worker-homeless - Remote workers need reliable workspace but can't predict availability
# P02: inconsistent-experience - Quality and atmosphere vary wildly between locations
# P03: neighborhood-disconnect - Shops feel like generic chains, not community spaces
# P04: food-disappoints - Customers want real meals, not just pastries from sysco
#
# Interaction strength values: 5 (strong), 3 (medium), 1 (weak), --- (none/unknown)
