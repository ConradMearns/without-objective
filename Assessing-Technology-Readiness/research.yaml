        Extensive criticism published in The Innovation Journal stated that 'the concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context'
      - >-
        Commercial Readiness Level (CRL) developed as a nine-point scale to be synchronized with TRL to assess market readiness and commercialization viability

# Key findings and gaps
synthesis:
  trl_adoption:
    - >-
      TRL is extremely widely adopted across government and industry
    - >-
      Standardized by ISO in 2013
    - >-

  trl_limitations:
    - >-
      Hardware-centric design inappropriate for software
    - >-
      Blurs different aspects of software readiness
    - >-
      Vague definitions leading to inconsistency
    - >-
      Loss of sophistication as usage spread

  existing_alternatives:
    - >-
      14+ different readiness level frameworks exist (MRL, SRL, IRL, CRL, DRL, etc.)
    - >-
      KTH Innovation uses multidimensional approach
    - >-
      CRL addresses commercial readiness synchronized with TRL
    - >-
      DevOps maturity models cover automation, observability, sustainability, maintainability
    - >-
      Chaos Maturity Model addresses robustness
    - >-
      Stage-Gate model for innovation stages

  gap_identified:
    - >-
      NO framework explicitly uses: Novelty → Viability → Practicality → Sustainability → Maintainability
    - >-
      Closest parallels are MVP/Beta/GA cycles, DevOps maturity, and CRL+TRL combined
    - >-
      These touch on elements but don't provide cohesive progression model for software
