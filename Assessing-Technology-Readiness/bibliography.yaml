  key_findings:
    - "Multiple 'SRL' acronyms exist: System Readiness Level (mathematical), Service Readiness Level (software services)"
    - "TRL widely criticized as hardware-centric and inappropriate for software"
    - "No standardized software-native readiness framework exists"

  gaps_identified:
    - "No framework explicitly addresses: Novelty → Viability → Practicality → Sustainability → Maintainability"
    - "Lack of lifecycle-spanning quantitative models"
    - "Insufficient attention to software decay and temporal aspects"
    - "Limited AI/ML-specific readiness frameworks"
    - "Few frameworks integrate business, technical, and operational dimensions"
